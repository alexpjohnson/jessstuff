stuff i want to do:
- expand/contract specs
- soft delete instead of hard delete?
- checkboxes to edit multiple?
- adding a parent at top level makes spec go all the way to the bottom. i mean i guess that makes sense
    -  implement 'order' - by default it's id but adding parent the order of new parent is order of child and order
        of child becomes 1? 
- make stuff endpoints
- fix deleting stuff
- mass apply tags
- mass edit
- editing does not need to refresh the whole page
- validation on mass add
- header needs to refresh after adding tags
- add ticket (as type of tag?) ticket vs label
- mass add something not right in unindenting *sigh*
- maybe wanna decrease padding or margin or whatever so specs are closer together
- mass adding children
- filtering by label doesn't go deep enough
- text editor? https://mindmup.github.io/bootstrap-wysiwyg/
